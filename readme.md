# Application Development Project

For this project, you will work with one or more other developers to create a unique product that makes use of an external API. Your product should solve a problem and be built collaboratively and thoughtfully, using the programming and planning tools you've learned so far.

## Project scoring

This project has five different parts on which you will be graded. Each part is weighted differently.

- 40% of the project is scored on **completion**.
- 15% of the project is scored through the **mastery rubric**.
- 5% of the project is scored through **stretch goals**.
- 20% of the project is scored through the **teamwork rubric**.
- 20% of the project is scored through the **presentation rubric**.

In total, you must receive at least 70% to complete this project. For example, you could attain 30% of points through the completion requirements, 10% of points through the mastery rubric, 10% of points through the teamwork rubric, 5% of points through the stretch goals, and 15% through the presentation rubric.

> **Note**: Your contributions to this group project must be equitable. Failure to make meaningful individual contributions to this project may lead to a separate assessment of some kind or a failing grade.
>
> Please also note that team members should work _across_ the stack. One team member should not be solely responsible for the front-end application, for example.

### Completion

To complete this project, you will need to build a React application that meets the following feature and technical requirements.

#### Overall requirements

1. The front-end application should be successfully deployed to the web.
1. Your front-end repository should have a `readme.md` file with setup instructions for your application. It should also include a link to your deployed application.
1. Your front-end repository should be built collaboratively. There should be commits from you and other developers on your team.
1. The application should have a coherent design and appear clean and easy to understand.

#### Planning requirements

Outside of coding, you are required to do the following in preparation for this project.

5. Group norms have been established with input from the entire group, which are recorded and accessible to everyone. Your project `readme.md` should include a document or link to these group norms.
1. You have identified a well-defined problem that your application intends to solve.
1. You have described what types of users would make up your customer base, identifying key characteristics.
1. You have developed _and used_ a Trello board, creating cards for each task and assigning those tasks to individual members of the team. Your Trello board should be linked in the `readme.md` file.
1. Your application repository includes images or links to wireframes that help shape the look and feel of your application.

#### Application requirements

To complete the front-end application, you will need to build a React application that implements the following features.

10. The application includes at least two separate pages, each of which has its own route.
1. The application leverages at least one external API, which is integral to the functionality of the application.
1. The application includes at least one form that can be submitted to change something in the application.
1. The application allows for sorting or filtering of some data via a user interface.
1. The application is mobile-first and can be used from a phone as well as from a desktop.

### Mastery rubric

This section of the project is designed to measure your increasing skill at writing good code and following best practices.

To view components of the mastery rubric, view the appropriate assignment on Canvas.

### Stretch goals

This section of the project measures your ability to go above and beyond in creating your project. To score points in this section, you should incorporate a feature, technology, or skill not explicitly required by the project instructions.

When you submit your pull request, _make sure to include a description of any stretch goals you implemented._ You may choose from the list below or come up with features or tasks that are more relevant to your specific implementation of the project.

- Implement more than one API, using both datasets to create a new use case.
- Integrate an external React package such as [React DnD](https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/about) or [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/).
- Leverage query parameters in your routes, to save the state of the page in the URL.

Points will be allocated in this section at the discretion of the instructor.

### Teamwork rubric

This section of the project is designed to allow you and your teammate(s) to self-reflect on what it was like working in a group with one another. These skills are critical for succeeding in the course and thriving as a software developer.

To view components of the teamwork rubric, view the appropriate assignments on Canvas.

### Presentation rubric

This section of the project is designed to measure your ability to present your project and your code. These skills are crucial for succeeding in the course and getting your first job as a software developer. To view components of the mastery rubric, view the appropriate assignment on Canvas.

## Getting started

_Do not_ fork this repository. Instead, create your repositories on GitHub and submit the URL directly to Canvas.

Then, follow the specifications above to create your application. Work with your instructors to approve your features before you begin working on them.
